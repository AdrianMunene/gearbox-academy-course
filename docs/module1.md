## Introduction to GitHub
GitHub is a cloud-based platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store, manage, and track changes to their code. Key features include:
    **Repositories**: Storage locations for project files.

    **Commits**: Snapshots of changes made to files.

    **Branches**: Parallel versions of a project that allow for experimentation.

    **Pull Requests**: A way to propose and review changes before merging them into the main branch.

## Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code. Important Git commands:
    `git init` - Initializes a new Git repository.

    `git clone <repo_url>` - Clones an existing repository.

    `git add <file>` - Stages changes for commit.

    `git commit -m "message"` - Saves staged changes.

    `git push` - Uploads local changes to a remote repository.

    `git pull` - Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.

    `git status` - Displays the current state of the repository.

## Introduction to Web Publishing (GitHub Pages)
GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service for static sites. Steps to set up a GitHub Pages site:
1. Create a repository and push project files.
2. Go to repository settings and enable GitHub Pages.
3. Select a publishing source (main branch or `docs/` folder).
4. Use Markdown (`.md`) files or HTML/CSS for content.
5. Access the published site at `https://adrianmunene.github.io/adrian_munene/`.

## Takeaway
Understanding Git, GitHub is essential for version control, project management, and collaboration while GitHub Pages enables of ease of sharing of documentation created in either Markdown or HTML and CSS. 

Git allows efficient tracking of code changes, while GitHub enables collaboration among developers. 

GitHub Pages serves as a platform for publishing project documentation.
