## Adrian Bikuri
I am a fourth year Computer Science student at The University of Nairobi, participating in the Gearbox Academy Course on Embedded Systems. I am deeply invested in furthering my knowledge on embedded systems, IoT applications, and real-time data processing. 

My fourth year project is a Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring System that implements Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection and Trend Prediction. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a low-cost and easily deployable air quality monitoring system that can be used to monitor air quality for environmental research.
## Gearbox Academy
