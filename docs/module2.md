# Module 2: Introduction to Embedded C

## Introduction to Embedded Systems
Embedded systems are specialized computing devices designed for specific tasks. They typically consist of:
- **Microcontrollers (MCUs)**: Small computers on a single chip (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico).
- **Firmware**: Low-level software controlling hardware behavior.
- **Peripherals**: Sensors, actuators, and communication modules.

## Introduction to IDEs (Thonny, Arduino, Pico C/C++ SDK)
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) simplify programming for embedded systems:
- **Thonny**: Beginner-friendly Python IDE for microcontrollers.
- **Arduino IDE**: Supports Arduino-compatible boards and C++ programming.
- **Pico C/C++ SDK**: A software development kit for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico in C/C++.
